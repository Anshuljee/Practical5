<img src="image.jpg" alt="image" style="margin-left: 45%;">
<p>Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar[9] (15 October 1542[a] – 27 October
1605),[12][13][14] popularly
known as Akbar the Great[15] (Persian pronunciation: [akbarɪ azam]) and also as Akbar I
(Persian
pronunciation: [akbar]),[16] was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to
1605. Akbar
succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young
emperor expand
and consolidate Mughal domains in India.</p>
<p>
A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal
Empire to
include much of the Indian subcontinent. His power and influence, however, extended
over the entire
subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unifthe vast Mughal
state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and
adopted
a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve
peace and
order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him
the support
of his non-Muslim subjects.Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar
strove to unite
far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an Indo-Persian culture,
to
himself as an emperor.
